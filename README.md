# RAP-and-RUC-Soundings

This code was produced to aid in research of the environments of supercells as they cross the Appalchain Mountains. The code was used to gather RAP and RUC Data to calculate kinematic and thermodynamic parameters of inflow points of the supercells. 


'Updated Sounding Code':
This file was used to siphon in RAP adn RUC model data from the NCEI Thredds server for a given point. Used MetPy and SharPy to calculate various paramerers. All that is needed to calulate and plot a sounding is the year, month, day, hour, latitude, and longitude.
